      <h2>Meet Our CEO & Co-Founder</h2>
      <img src="ceo4.jpg" alt="CEO Ivan Grakowski" class="ceo-photo" width="500" height="600">
      <p><strong>Ivan Grakowski</strong>, now in his 40s, is the sharp-minded CEO and co-founder of Honey BI Consultancy. With two decades of experience in data systems, Ivan's fascination with efficiency and systems thinking began not in a corporate setting but in nature.

During a retreat in his early 30s, Ivan observed the rhythm and coordination of bees while hiking through a forest. The synchronized precision of the hive how each bee plays a critical role in collecting, processing, and distributing resources sparked a realization. “It was like watching a living dashboard,” he says. “Each bee a node, each route a flow of information, and the hive a thriving system powered by clarity and purpose.”

From that moment, Ivan envisioned a business that could replicate nature’s most brilliant architects. He founded Honey BI Consultancy on the principles of agility, clarity, and intelligent collaboration. Just as bees turn scattered pollen into golden honey, Honey BI transforms raw data into insights that empower businesses to act with confidence.

Under Ivan’s leadership, Honey BI has grown into a trusted force in business intelligence, helping clients interpret their data and move swiftly toward success with the refined precision of a hive in motion.
